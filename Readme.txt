The source code is divided in two parts:

Repeat Experiments: you can re-run our experiments and check the effectiveness of our proposed approach in a 5X2 cross validation scenario on the CPHPALL (uncompressed images) dataset. Results can vary a little bit depending on the precison your CPU uses to calculate the probabilities.

Do your own BKS: Here you can check how the multiscale BKS is built and also can change the code to include your images and/or compare your approach against ours.

In both cases you must download a folder called aux. Available to download in ftp://www.recod.ic.unicamp.br/2016-tip-copy-move-dataset. Extract this folder in the same folder as the source code folders are in your PC.

Scripts for calculating performance metrics have been added too.
